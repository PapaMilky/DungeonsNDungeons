# Dungeons'N'Dungeons
A naive and half-finished attempt at creating a game from scratch.

## Context
Dungeons'N'Dungeons (DnD for short) is a half-baked attempt at creating a turn based dungeon-crawler from near-scratch. DnD was inspired by a school-assignment I created during 2020 where our class was tasked to create a "text adventure game" using python to display our competence in IT and problem-solving skills. Only recently did I find the original copy I had submitted, finding it half completed and lacking in any of the elements that made the game unique. 
So I decided to remake it.

## The Plan

### Step 1 - Planning
The flowchart I made for the game was rough and only intended to be used as an outline/guide during the main "creation phase" of development.
A link to the flowchart I had made originally can be found [here](https://mermaid.live/view#pako:eNqVV1lv4kgQ_islP4FyiAzJJEE7kQjkUiYJCmRZrc1DxxTBWtPtaTfJsHH--1YfvoDMaJEwdvdXX93V5t0LxRS9jjeLxVs4Z1LBqB_wrj9CuYg4iyewt3eWPSTII_4CV2yBGZz7-hdueKRgIEWIaToJ-Dkh97KeRKYQGJ-a_QyGw0t_yGYIw_lSTcUbh8slD1UkuJM525R5xNSnr1hK4oY7xtkLys_hdyzivr5UrAk4KbbwGBmHpwS6JDB6usn5wLmoTSEzr59G_YfxfaOxYWezqenIHvhD812iCucZ9ChYLFQo_UZxC32mWHOyCb7guFj5DfNTgOwTBQ3UIjnId-8oH_HG9he_EXh2ZaiYSgN-jSxW84D3cYY8RPI3QZxS6pRi4T-Bt0HRzjV8F4KyzJ5j1JjSeINDY0q5WJiziTM2lcv_w64alyVrV5XWLQy4ye3W1N-eX9NDjPL9FlfPgkm9kSxVCm7941fSVA25eF7vcCVZMo_CrQTkIjWIbQJ9fS8XCGaawsASRuXThUpsMMZQCUllM2ysL-sSo5gMbcXcCTJNSOdGxcMS8pRMtR8lz3X0Mo_pW3PJ4I05qAtfwIDJlJo4g0GY-q5TTDGaGBd6bKgEV1LEsAM908IaQWKVonbG4xTq5W-6N4dr9FjIeEpotUxgGEpE6rbx0A88SwB2f7RKEBoPiY4Gi-NVR0vQF6fNwDMGjn8foHE9QHlO61ExMI0KvEcySnKoFmSREnJdu0Po0r4dY1Dg0cjRybYzx6SdKjYhK83yb828Kyrll4aWsAdONGQdC-2wyjF-ZTWv10kpWEzji78G-XamH_yLnwnKSPenmYrf8RVjPd9zDqi6AuMr5I2GjQPdkkZyrNkk0E21Zm5m0LWmEH0sJDWJu_EtzD2aieugelR_QmIHRuZ-cwr7RLZ-LqinR2auuZCZJ85ye_B8InrDX5GTc6tM3-bixWrF6IAbUi3-iD-WmCo75KEnZJJiZYS5htBHgkWbmlsfxdbgLay9ub5WgTodVJZ0rRJu4iwhnQI2CTVWm0xd4BRRslnIaZozV_EDGXEF9_jmJP6M0ug5iiO1cj2gFdic1Ph1oF4RxsgSCqs5GkxIt4Ir51rBugU2iNkqP2cKXNkktcA6kDt0NlF1rhxWUdpjcbiMdfM4aFF4VgNNckL4JazPFvRWAecspZH4oO1QFCVz2FSjMPlEizW7VGK1Wi00n-i66aRVWZq_jnKWE6yKqqh348ce2dCP0oQktuYg8KhJ8kiMbuHMmeBOe5qI_QvdJL5zu09zZw5mqTKY1gmd04bPka8T6vqyd_kkzL3SGmjC3Pd9q8yeLZN1uAuVRdvmbLhRgHmzjiOSNxPemt-skQRenQYy_ZJAm3qsDgQ1SKrtpSdKgSWsBNcKurDQKewQdiFvOWo64irjQg89sSQVZ3Y2g-6BSOJCR4R06TcmGqRyNXPvqOk8Us90bqZ0rmrpb9Ci8WxlvzmOHTgwR2muirwyG3tPSUZ1KtQcpSYmip1XJiM9RYAtjB1iBimVLyTOXTMBqZ8NUTdNoxdb3y4emQP65RpYlPaA4s3pDZs4LMqQ2MQXtVfZMS-Q2zbcK-a2rfzwKGYU1Yn7NyAo-mYcdGf6wK-XE73qeLvegs5jFk3pb9F7wAECj0JDNF6Hbqc4Y8uYshDwD4KypRLDFQ-9zozFKe56S5P2fsReJFsUqwnjXufd--l19o4P9o-OTg6_Hp20jg5a7dNdb-V12odH-4eHh6eHx1-O2q3T9vHHrvevEETQ2j-1n-N2-6Td-np6YNj-NptKLvHjPyWfypU).

Though the flowchart was crude and poorly thought out, it was enough to satisfy my urge for planning.

### Step 2 - The "Pre-Requisites"
During this phase of creation I mainly focused on the non-crucial aspects of the game that were not involved deeply within the main-game-loop.\
Things such as:
- The Main Screen
- The "New Game" Screen
- A Seed-Based Procedural Generation
- World Saving
- World and Data Structs
- A "Load Game" Screen with Dynamic Options
- A Function To Decode and Parse The Save

### Step 3 - The "Main Loop"
The Main Loop is where the development of this game kinda fell-apart, originally I had intended to give it an isometric view, but this proved to be harder than I was capable of tackling while in such a severe state of sleep deprivation.\
If ever I do gain some more experience with HTML5 and JS and have confidence in creating something that fits the requirements, this project likely will be finished off the way it was originally intended.

## Building
Building is quite simple, just\
``git clone <REPO>``\
``cd <REPO>``\
``go mod download``\
``wails build``\
and check the ``build/bin`` folder for your executable.
